SPARK Definitive guide - dbc files

These dbc files covers the most content from SPARK definitive guide which is required for data engineer. Please note that I dont have any credit for this and I have only organized in databricks notebooks so that any one can parallely run the code to see how the APIs are changing the data. This covers the content from Chapter 1 to 18. I have created this file during my preparation for Databricks SPARK certification and thought this will help anyone who is preparing for it.

Download the dbc file and upload it to databricks community edition at https://community.cloud.databricks.com/login.html by registering for a free account. Create a cluster in community edition and attach this dbc file to the cluster.

Download the data from https://github.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide/tree/master/data and upload the relevant dataset to DBFS file for each chapter mentioned in the definitive guide book. Please note all datasets are not required to upload
